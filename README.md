# Summer2019Internship
A report on the projects that I worked on during the summer of 2019. Contributed to the dashboard that the accounting team and Operations team used. My screens made it to production ! also learned a lot about CI/CD on azure DevOps.
I was not allowed to take any code with me since, it was a hedge fund with strict IT department.
